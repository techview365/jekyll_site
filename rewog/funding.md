    <h2>Our plans for Gnoppix</h2>
    <p>We have several plans for Gnoppix' future, many features that take time
      and money to come true.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Jarvis - AI Desktop</h3>
        <p>Instantly Generate High Quality Content, Manage your Calendar and Meetings, create Websites, Listings, Blogs & More. Save Time And Money, Writing Clever, Original Content And End Writer's Block Forever</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Privacy in Linux</h3>
        <p> Modern Linux operating systems provide many tools to run more securely. Take back control of your online privacy   
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Gnoppix Mobile</h3>
        <b>Still implementing!</b>
        <p>This is a feature in early development. It is a complete replacement for your Mobile OS  </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Fingerprint/Faceunlock</h3>
        <p>This is one of the coolest feature of Gnoppix Linux.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Gnoppix Linux is (today) a project driven by the effort of a very small developer team and the support of a magnificent community!</p>
