        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of text that are stored on your computer. 
            They are used to store information about your preferences and 
            to help you navigate the site. They are also used to track your usage 
            of the site and to help us improve it.
        </p>
        <p>We specifically use cookies for analytics purposes. This helps us
            understand how people use the site, how they reach it and how they
            interact with it.</p>
        <h2>Collected data</h2>
        <p>We collect some data to understand how users reach gnoppix.com. 
            This data help us to know what kind of content is most viewed, if
            the user reaches certain pages and how they interact with the site.
            We also use this data to improve the site and to make it more
            useful, e.g. by providing you with more relevant content or by
            improving the existing to better meet your needs.</p>
        <p>We use an Analytics platform called Countly to collect the needed
            data for statistics purposes.</p>
            
        <b>Referral URLs</b>
        <p>We use referral URLs to understand how users reach gnoppix.com.
            This also help us find out who is linking to the site and how they
            do it (reviews, blog posts, etc.).</p>
        
        <b>Device type</b>
        <p>We use device type for UX purposes. This helps us testing the website
            on the most used devices and to be sure that the website is compatible
            with them.</p>
        
        <b>Browser type</b>
        <p>Also the browser type is used for UX purposes. This helps us to
            understand which browsers are most used and which are not and
            if we should still support them.</p>
        
        <b>Language</b>
        <p>We use language to understand which languages are most used and
            which are not. This helps us to improve the site and the translation
            support, e.g. if we should add a new language.</p>
        
        <b>Operating system</b>
        <p>We use operating system only for statistics purposes. We would be 
            scared to find that Windows users reach this site (jk). This could
            help us understand if Gnoppix has an interest in other systems as 
            well.</p>
