In general, Gnoppix Core is already very good for Linux beginners. The Gnoppix Core desktop has over 10,000 hours of development, which is my personal contribution to our society. Fortunately, Gnoppix has received backup from powerful companies, which will help to continue the Gnoppix story.

Exclusively to Gnoppix, we offer excellent hardware detection and premium Linux support. If you're new to Linux, you might feel intimidated to use it. Thankfully, with one of the best Linux distros for beginners, you don't have to possess any coding or programming experience.

## When we started developing Gnoppix over 20 years ago

We had a vision: to prove that the power of Linux could be accessible to everyone, and that you didn't need to sacrifice your privacy or freedom to have a great and user-friendly computing experience.

Ever since, our team has worked tirelessly to turn this vision into a reality. We've designed Gnoppix to be a simple yet powerful Linux desktop that's easy to use for everyone, regardless of their technical expertise.

None of this could have been possible without the support of our community. We're grateful for the feedback, contributions, and encouragement we've received over the years.


## Gnoppix: A free and open-source Linux distribution that puts the user first

At Gnoppix, we believe that everyone should have access to powerful and user-friendly technology. That's why we're committed to creating products that respect your privacy, give you back control, and champion openness and accessibility.

That's why Gnoppix will always be free and open source. We believe that everyone should have the right to use, modify, and share our software without restriction.

To reward and celebrate those who support our mission, we created Gnoppix Pro. It brings together the most advanced features and the best open source software so you can unleash the full potential of your computer.

## When you buy Gnoppix, you're not just buying a product, you're supporting a mission.

Every purchase or donation helps us to continue developing Gnoppix Linux, contributing to open source projects, and creating products and services that make Linux more accessible to everyone.

Because we're funded entirely by the community, we're able to put you—the user—first in everything we do. That means we're focused on creating a Linux distribution that is easy to use, powerful, and secure.

We're grateful for the support of our community, and we're committed to continuing to make Gnoppix Linux the best Linux distribution possible.

## Frequently asked questions

Q: **Is there any more information about Gnoppix and how to use it?**
A: Yes. We've created the [Gnoppix Documentation Project](https://docs.gnoppix.com)
. If you still have questions, you can just ask the Gnoppix community on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/tmHjQmgBW9). There are always people online around the world who can help you with your questions.

Q: **Does Gnoppix collect any user data?**
A: Gnoppix does not collect any data. You can even run and upgrade your system anonymously without any traces.

Q: **How long will Gnoppix Linux get software updates for?**
A: Gnoppix will receive software updates and security patches until at least June 2028. So you'll have plenty of time to upgrade to future versions to extend support.

Q: **Can I try Gnoppix before I buy it?**
A: Yes. Gnoppix Core is for our professional users who don't need support but still want to use Gnoppix.

Q: **How much does Gnoppix cost?**
A: You can completely download Core and Lite for free. For more advanced features, additional apps, and support, you can purchase Gnoppix Pro from [here ](https://ko-fi.com/gnoppix/shop)

Q: **I bought Gnoppix PRO. Now what?**
A: We'll generate you an account and a personal web certificate. This will take around one working day. We're sorry about this, but we must be sure that you are the person who is accessing our services and infrastructure.

Q: **Can I also run my old Windows applications and games on Gnoppix?**
A: Yes. We've created an easy-to-use Windows integration, since users were totally overwhelmed by configuring the application.

Q: **I'm not sure my computer will run with Gnoppix?**
A: You can download the Gnoppix Core version and try it. The Pro version just comes with much more applications and support.

Q: **How long does it take to get Gnoppix Linux?**
A: It depends on your internet speed and computer hardware. Once you get the image, it typically takes between 5 and 15 minutes to install.

Q: **Will my application still work on Gnoppix?**
A: You can install from the world's largest software library of apps from the built-in Software store, including many popular apps you know and love. Gnoppix is also natively compatible with Debian (.deb or .AppImage executables).

Q: **Can I use another window manager, such as KDE?**
A: Yes, you can. A license of Gnoppix Pro qualifies you to download the pre-setup member images at the [Gnoppix Member Server](https://patreon.gnoppix.com). We support XFCE, KDE, and GNOME.

Q: **Why did you choose the Debian packaging system and software?**
A: Debian is completely free software. We do not depend on the goodwill of a.e. Ubxnxu, which are just packages from Debian. If you remember, there was an issue with Red Hat-based distributions. This will never happen with Gnoppix. An excellent video from Jay [Why Corporate Owned Linux Distributions like Red Hat are a Bad Idea ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfyM7zE6KM) explains this in more detail.
