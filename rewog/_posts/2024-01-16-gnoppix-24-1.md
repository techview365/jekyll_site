To earn its privacy credentials the distro routes all Internet-bound traffic through the Tor anonymous network. Earlier, the distro used a launcher script to fetch the latest Tor release from the Internet, but now bundles it by default.

In addition to the Tor browser, the distro also includes a couple of tools that are designed for use over the Tor network. Thereâ€™s the anonymous file-sharing program called OnionShare and the Ricochet instant messaging client.

Besides the Tor tools, the distro also has a few other privacy and security enhancing programs such as the Sweeper utility to clear the cache and temporary files, VeraCrypt encryption software and the Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit (MAT).
