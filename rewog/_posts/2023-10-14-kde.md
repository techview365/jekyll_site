Happy birthday, KDE!

Today, we celebrate the birthday of KDE, one of the most popular free and open-source desktop environments in the world. KDE is used by millions of people around the globe, and it is known for its user-friendly interface, its wide range of features, and its commitment to open-source software.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank some very special people (to me), my ex-colleagues, friends, and companions in the early KDE times, Uni Tuebingen where our hole irc channel meet or few days in Antalya :)  

        * Martin Konold: Martin is one of the co-founders of KDE, and he has played a key role in the project's development since its inception. Martin is a passionate advocate for free and open-source software, and his contributions to KDE have been invaluable.
        * Torsten Rahn: Torsten is another co-founder of KDE, and he has also played a major role in the project's development. Torsten is a skilled programmer and a talented designer, and his work has helped to make KDE one of the most user-friendly and visually appealing desktop environments available.
        * Eva Brucherseifer: Eva is a longtime KDE contributor, and she has made significant contributions to the project's documentation and translation efforts. Eva is a dedicated advocate for accessibility, and she has worked hard to make KDE more accessible to users with disabilities.
        * Ralf Nolden: Ralf is another longtime KDE contributor, and he is known for his work on the Plasma desktop environment. Ralf is a skilled programmer and a talented designer, and his work has helped to make KDevelop available.

These are just a few of the many people who have contributed to the success of KDE over the years. I am grateful to all of the KDE contributors for their hard work and dedication.

On this special day, I would like to wish KDE a very happy birthday! May KDE continue to grow and thrive in the years to come.
