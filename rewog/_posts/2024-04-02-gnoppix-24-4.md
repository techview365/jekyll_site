# Gnoppix 24.3.15  

As [announced](https://gnoppix.atlassian.net/wiki/x/DYBRAg) earlier, the next public release of Gnoppix is scheduled for April 2nd, 2024. This update focuses on enhancing AI integration while prioritizing usability and, of course, your privacy.

One of the biggest dangers of using commercial AI platforms is the potential exposure of your private data. Imagine your doctor's files being analyzed – would you truly want such sensitive information shared?

A friend who runs a company based in the EU expressed immense gratitude for our local AI solution. EU privacy laws restrict them from sharing data with third parties.

Tired of AI outputs appearing only when you request security testing for private websites? Don't be – Gnoppix offers an alternative to the ever-present feeling of "Big Brother watching you."

Does this mean you can't leverage cutting-edge AI technologies? Absolutely not! Check out detailed changes: [Gnoppix Changelog Wiki:](https://gnoppix.atlassian.net/wiki/x/DYBRAg) for more information.
