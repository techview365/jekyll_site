It's been a little late, but I was very busy starting the year.

With the relaunch last year, a lot happened: we received a lot of feedback, things changed significantly, and we're grateful for all your suggestions.

The major change was moving away from Gnome to XFCE as our main and only supported desktop.

Just a reminder, I'm looking for maintainers for KDE and Gnome desktops. Personally maintaining them myself is impossible. I need your help. (Direct ask for assistance, referencing XFCE as a model.)

With a dedicated version, Gnoppix PRO and Gnoppix Membership, we hope to generate income to cover Gnoppix development costs.

We released the LTS Gnoppix with 5 years of support.

We found new sponsors who help continue the Gnoppix story.

I was invited to several technology events, including Google, where I shared Gnoppix as an example of the open-source software way.

I took on a mentor position to support young software developers and engineers.

Bombarded with AI questions, I implemented an open-source AI chatbot, Gnoppix Stable Diffusion. Gnoppix 24 also introduces the Gnoppix AI installer, letting you install nearly 100 AI applications with just one click.

I remain committed to supporting open-source AI in 2024. Open-source AI is like a shared recipe book for artificial intelligence, fostering collaboration, innovation, and trust. It democratizes access to powerful tools, making AI development quicker, cheaper, and more inclusive.

Faster progress: More cooks in the kitchen mean faster innovation and problem-solving.

Lower barriers: Open-source tools are free and accessible, empowering anyone to build with AI.

Wider impact: AI benefits more people when it's shared and adaptable.

Trust and transparency: Openness fosters scrutiny and builds trust in AI's workings.

Responsible development: Open collaboration helps mitigate bias and promote ethical AI.

Open-source AI is like a rising tide, lifting all boats. It's a win-win for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole.

With Gnoppix 24, we now have a stable, reproducible, and successful development process (from the source code) and can start optimizing and implementing features for you that are on our roadmap for 24.
We will continue to provide you with a Linux desktop with a focus on your privacy and security.

Special thanks to Hetzner, Sourceforge, Google, Tuta, and Evokehub for supporting Gnoppix with their services, manpower, and infrastructure.
