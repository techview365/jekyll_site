## Happy Birthday GNU Project

[The GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/), a non-profit organization that promotes software freedom, is celebrating its 40th anniversary on September 27, 2023 in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland.

The project was founded in 1983 by Richard Stallman with the goal of creating a complete Unix-like operating system that would be free software. The GNU Project has since developed many popular free software programs, including the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the GNU Debugger (GDB), and the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP).

The GNU Project has played a major role in the development of the free software movement. The project's philosophy of software freedom is based on the idea that everyone should have the right to use, modify, and share software.

The 40th anniversary celebration of the GNU Project will be a major event for the free software community. The celebration will include talks, workshops, and other activities related to free software.
